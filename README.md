# Fable Flutter app

Flutter app written in F# and compiled to Dart with Fable 4. To start compilation run `./build.sh` or `./build.cmd` (or just copy & paste the commands to a terminal).

To debug, use the Flutter-compatible IDE of your choice. You'll have to trigger hot reload manually after changes (e.g. in VS Code with Flutter extension press Ctr+F5).
